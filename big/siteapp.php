    These days, from individuals to businesses, it seems not possible to survive without using mobile devices. According to StatCounter, mobile currently accounts for 55.55% of all internet traffic worldwide. Due to extreme growth in the use of mobile devices, every business will need to be present on mobile devices. Either mobile app or responsive website can be great solutions, so I’m going to talk about the two different features.
</p>

<h3>A Responsive website</h3>

<p class="indent">
    A responsive website is built using fluid grids and a flexible layout that work great on any device, whether it is a desktop monitor, laptop, smartphone or tablet. The view in a screen responds and resizes itself automatically depending on the device.
</p>

<h3>"What are the benefits of using the Responsive website?"</h3>

<p>
    <strong>A broad range of users:</strong> Responsive design can be used on a variety of devices, therefore, many users can access the website from any device in all of the sizes.
</p> 

<p>
    <strong>Cost and time of development:</strong> It is comparatively faster to build and launch a website than an app, and it is also fast to change and easy to perform testing on it. The shorter development time might affect the cost of building a website.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Boost for SEO:</strong> Search engine optimization(SEO) is the process of optimizing web pages and their content to be easily discoverable by users searching for terms relevant to websites.
    In terms of business, marketing is essential and SEO is one of the best ways to drive traffic to websites. Now, Google is responsible for the majority of the search engine traffic (they dominate 91.86% of the market share.) in the world. Responsive websites (mobile friendly) can improve serving and ranking in Google search.
</p>

<h3>what is a Mobile app?</h3>

<p class="indent">
    Mobile apps are applications that are designed to run on mobile devices and customized to each Operating System (OS). They can easily use all the capabilities of a modern smartphone: camera, microphone, NFC, Face ID, GPS, etc.
</p>

<h3>"The advantages of Mobile apps"</h3>

<p>
    <strong>Functional:</strong> Apps have greater functionality than mobile-oriented sites because they’re customized into the device’s OS. It means that apps can access mobile-specific features and tools like push notifications, geolocation, cameras, etc. Such features can make the user have more fun and positive experience. Ultimately, well-made apps can help increase the conversion rate.
</p>

<p>
   Launching their app is such a good way for <strong>brand awareness and marketing</strong>. In addition to that, providing personalization can be useful for analyzing user behaviors for future development.
</p>

<p>   
    While websites need an internet connection to load, many functions in apps can be performed without connecting. It can make users engage more time with apps.
</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p class="indent">
    Both responsive websites and mobile apps have upsides and downsides, and I can’t tell which is the best option to choose. It should be considered in many ways to pick a choice. If a service only relies on mobile apps such as Uber, Snow camera app, and many mobile device based apps, you will need to launch a mobile app. The important thing is, as the growth of the usage of mobile devices, either responsive websites or apps is inevitable for our lives and businesses.
